# RofiPathManager
This Bash script allows users to manage file paths easily through a simple Rofi menu interface. It presents two main options: to add a new path or select an existing one. When the user chooses to add, they are prompted to enter the new path, which is then appended to a designated file. If a user selects an existing path, it opens that path using the code command (typically for Visual Studio Code).

In the future, you can enhance this script by creating a keyboard shortcut to run it quickly from anywhere on your system. This will streamline your workflow, allowing you to access your paths with just a few keystrokes.
